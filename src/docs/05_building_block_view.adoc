Motivation::

Software must be adaptable, maintainable, scalable... For this reason, it is
usualy layered.
A first vision of our app divides it in three parts:
** _<Graphic User Interface (GUI):>_ defines what the user will see (f.e css).
** _<Logical:>_ this part is focused on calculus and operations.
** _<Persistence:>_ conexion with different systems to store data
