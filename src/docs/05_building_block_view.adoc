_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

Software must be adaptable, maintainable, scalable... For this reason, it is
usualy layered.
A first vision of our app divides it in three parts:
** _Graphic User Interface (GUI):_ defines what the user will see (f.e css).
** _Logical:_ this part is focused on calculus and operations.
** _Persistence:_ conexion with different systems to store datas
