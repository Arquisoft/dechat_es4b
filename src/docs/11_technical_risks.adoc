== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]
***

This page contains a list of all the risks we can encounter during the project as well as measures to try to minimize and solve them.

***
=== 11.1 Risks:
* Solid is a completely new technology to the group and it might take us time until we get used to its functionality.
* Although we've used Javascript in the past, it's not our go-to programming language.
* Angular is a new Framework we haven't used before.
* None of us have worked with this many people before and some of us didn't know each other  before.
* English is not our first language and it can lead to some errors in the documentation.

=== 11.2 Measures to solve them:
* Try to learn as much as possible about Solid, Angular, and Javascript before starting to work on the actual code, and keep researching and learning during the whole project.
* Increasing the communication in the group so everyone know what everyone is doing and has to do.
