== Design Decisions
At this stage of the project few design decisions have been taken. 

We will follow a P2P architecture without a dedicated database, all users information will be stores in their PODs. If this approach does not fit well as the project progresses, we could use https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] because it connects well with Angular and it is also a popular combination part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)[MEAN stack].

|===
| Property | Decision | Explanation
| Architecture | Peer-to-Peer (P2P) | It is mandatory in a decentralized Solid app
| Framework | Angular | We chose Angular because it is one of the most popular frameworks in javaScript world and there are some examples of Solid apps built over it
|Database | None | There is no need for a database, each chat user will store their data and messages in their personal POD
