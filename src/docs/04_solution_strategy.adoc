=== 4.2 Decisions
Short explanation of the decisions of the project

* Angular: Is an open-source framework based on Type-Script. We use it 
because is the easiest way to create web-apps for us and is intuitive.

* Javascript: Is a lenguage based on ECMASCRIPT, with it we can do
applications in the web.
We will use Javascript because in the project we will implementate
a chat, as we know, and this language is the best and easiest for client
applications.

* Node.js: Is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time 
environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

* Solid: Is a web decentralization project, just what we need to do the 
project.
