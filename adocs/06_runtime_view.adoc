== Runtime View

=== Fitst Scenario: Login

*Although basic is one of the most important scenarios because if a user is not logged in can not do anything.*

. User opens the app in his browser. User could be logged or
not.
.. If the user is logged in, he will be able to start using the app.
.. If he is not logged in, he can click the login button. A popup in which the user
must enter his Solid credentials (from solid community, inrupt, his WebID). In case the user does not have an account
he will be able to create one.

. Once the user is logged in one way or another, the app will allow him to start a chat, continue a indivudual
or group chat and create new groups, as friends and groups are loaded 
as soon as the sing in process is done.

=== Second Scenario: Send a message

*The main functionality of the application is to send messages. Here we show how to di it.*

. We assume that the *user* is logged in. If not he won't be able
to chat.
. The user clicks the *New Chat* button. A list of his friends in solid and
groups he is part of is shown in a ComboBox. 
. The user looks for his friend or group and selects an option.
. If the individual or group conversation has already started, messages, images and
emotes will be loaded from the *POD* to the *panel* by the communication module(Group or individual). If on the other hand the message is the first 
of the conversation the panel will appear empty.
. The message is written in the text area and when the user clicks the button
or enter key, it is sent.
 .. If the conversation is individual the message will be stored in userÂ´s
 own *POD* and will give the other user permission to read it.
 .. If it is a gropup conversation, the message will be stored in group creator's *POD*.
 . The user or users in the chat will be able to load this message immediately if they are
 on the chat. If not, the next time they sign up to the app, the message will be loaded.

=== Third Scenario: Create a group

. One more time We assume that the *user* is logged in.
. The user clicks the *Create Group* button. A list of his friends in solid are
loaded from his account and a TextBox is displayed to enter a group name.
. He enters the name and select the checkBoxes of friends he want to be in the grop.
. Finally the user clicks the *create* button.
. From the main view of the app, the user will be able to select new chat.
The name of the newly created group will appear in the combobox mentioned above.
