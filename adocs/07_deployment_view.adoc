== Deployment View

Our chat deChat is a client side application that runs in user's browser to connect to a Solid POD to chat with our friends, so to use it we only need a computer 
and an Internet connection, we developed this application in Firefox and Chrome, so those are the browsers we recommend to use.

We can see a first node which is the node of the computer of the user, he connect to the browser with Internet. The second node is the application, we need 
a server to connect to the chat. Finally we connect to the last node, this node is SOLID Server who provides us user's POD and the receiver or receivers POD,
we connect to user's pod to store the message and we send it to the receiver or receivers.

The distribution of our system was the same in all scenarios because we only need a computer with internet, we could test it in home and in the
university the same way.
Since the start, we knew this was a browser application and SOLID was our system to storage information of our communication, so we implementate the chat for
a browser like Firefox, so we obviously need a computer with internet connection and the browser. Any computer can use dechat application.
After connecting to the chat in the browser we use internet to connect to the SOLID Server and now we can send messages to another person.
