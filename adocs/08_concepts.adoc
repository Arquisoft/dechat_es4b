=== Domain concepts

* *Domain models* We use a domain where we have an index file which depends of libraries, then we have various folders when we
store testing and documentation.

=== User Experience concepts

* *User interface* As user interface we can understand the interface of the application, in this case the interface is a
 normal chat interface like other chats applications.
 
 
* *Internationalization* We did the application in English and for the moment we will not add internationalization to other lenguages.


=== Safety and security concepts

* *Security and safety* The security and safety in the project is key because this application is based in Solid which is
decentralized and safe. We store the information we send in the PODs to avoid  problems in the security.

=== Architecture and design patterns

* *P2P Architecture* is a commonly used computer networking architecture in which each workstation, or node, has the same capabilities 
and responsibilities.

=== “Under-the-hood” concepts

* *Session handling* We log in with our user of SOLID in the application, once we are into the service we can communicate with the
server to interact with other users.

* *Persistence* to save our information, we store it on PODs on SOLID, so we don't use information stored in databases.

* *Communication and integration* in this chat we use asynchronous methods. We are working on the integration in another sites.

=== Development concepts

* *Build and code generation* The build and code generation in our project is done in javascript with Node.js. We must have instaled
Node in our computer to build the project. 

* *Test and deploy* For testing we use cucumber for acceptance testing and we use BDD. For asynchronous testing we use mocha. To deploy
the project we must have Node installed.


=== Operational concepts

* *Administration* For the administration of this project we work as a team so we administrate it equally.

* *Disaster recovery* We have this project in GitHub so if something happened to the project locally, we have a copy there.
