== Building Block View


=== Whitebox Overall System

DeChat is a descentralized chat created with SOLID. SOLID is a project led by Tim Berners-Lee wich aims to change the way Web Apps work today.
To make this posible, as a first part of the project, SOLID has created SOLID Pods. In a future stage of the development these pods will not be
neccesary.

After this introduction, let's talk about our project and how all will work.
The App will have three main elements: pods, users and DeChat App. These parts will comunicate with each other.

- *User*: users will use DeChat App to comunicate to other users.
- *DeChat App*: the app will provide all the funcionality to users and will comunicate with SOLID Pods.
- *SOLID Pods*: they will work as an intermediary between the diferent apps of users.

=== Level 2

Our chat is built using three main blocks:

User Interface:: An single HTML file to present all the application. To control what we want to display every moment it's used JavaScript, and specially jQuery library.
Logic:: This block is used to connect PODs administration with User Interface.
Data Storing :: In this project we are using SOLID PODs. The main reason: each user is owner of his own data. This block will be written and readed by logic, and after that present the data.

=== Level 3

index:: the main module in the system is index.js. It is used to control every action user does in the page, and call other modules and functions.

core:: is used to administrate the communications. This module uses another more specific modules like the communication of groups or personal (private). They will connect with PODs.

private communication :: Responsible for communications between users, sending and retrieval of messages.

group communication :: Responsible for communications between users that share a group, sending and retrieval of messages.

encrypt :: Codes from plain text to base64 and vice versa.

notification manager :: Manages the occurrence of notifications when a message is received or a group is created

personal:: used to load data from users.

messages:: A simple class with different attributes to store messages
